# Introduction

SNP-Crackle-Pop (SCP) is a web service that fetches data from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. For the most part, SCP accesses NCBI's data through a "back door" via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). When data is requested, SCP will use NCBI to fetch the data. Then the data is stored in SCP's database. Having this data readily available makes it much faster to do things (like run scripts, analysis, etc.) with stored data rather than asking NCBI for the data every time.
