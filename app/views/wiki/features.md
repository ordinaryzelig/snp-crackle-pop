Here are some things you can do with SNP-Crackle-Pop.

## Search SNPs

* Search by rs# (`9268480` or `rs9268480`).
* Search by location (chromosome and base position).

## Search Genes

* Search by symbol (`SS2`), name (`BTNL2`), or loc (`6p21.3`).
* Search by location (chromosome and base position).

## Search Genome Projects

* Search by name (`1000 Genomes Project Pilot 1`)

## Download SNPs, Genes

The data that SCP stores can be downloaded as a comma-separated values (CSV) file. They can be viewed in spreadsheet applications such as iWork Numbers and Microsoft Excel.

**NOTE**: Currently, data contained in downloaded file is not highly refined. For the sake of simplicity, it is more or less a regurgitation of data from the database.

## Search SNPs and Genes by location

You can search SNPs and Genes by location. Enter a chromosome and a range of base positions (e.g. chromosome `6`, between `32363840` and `32363850`). SCP will perform the search and download all the data as a CSV file.

You can also search for exact base position by just entering a single base position as opposed to a range. SCP will search for that base position +/- 1. For example, if you search for a base position of `10`, SCP will search for base positions between and including `9` and `10`. The reason for this is because NCBI is not consistent with the way they present base position data. So we need a small margin of error.

## View Data on NCBI

When looking at a certain SNP, GENE, etc., a link to the corresponding NCBI page will be available so you can see more in-depth data straight from the source.
